 Chat App
 
- Authentication
	For authentication part, made a basic authentication that user should connect with username and correct token (token set to “xxx” in message.gateway.ts file.). Normally I suggest to use at least JWT token and it should be inside header of the connection not in parameters part for authentication.

- Sending message
	All users are in a group with their friends. So, I put them in a room with their self userId and friendsIds. The same rooms used for sending message and for “online” or “offline” event. 

N server implementation
	SocketAdapter added with redis for this purpose. So, as long as the web socket connected to the same redis, server count can be increased directly. Also I would add mongoDB and Redis cluster in end product for better performance since the app has a lots o users.

Testing the challenge 
	For testing, I have added some parts for. 
	- First 11th line can be uncommented inside the user.service.ts for adding 4 users. (user1 has 3 friends, user2 and user4 have 2 friends, user3 has 1 friend.) 
	- After running the command docker-compose-up, port 3000 will be exposed. Example connection through socket.io is “http://localhost:3000?userName=user3&token=xxx".
	- There are 3 listeners in client part, 
		- “newChat” which user gets new messages.
		- “unseenChat” which user gets last 100 messages when first connects.
		- “userStatus” which user gets “online” or “offline” events about its friends.
	- 1 listener in server part,
		- “chat” where users send their messages to. 
	- Also in docket-compose.yml file I have added a second backend for testing that you can uncomment and try. The port is 3001 there. "http://localhost:3001?userName=user3&token=xxx" 


Thank you 😊
